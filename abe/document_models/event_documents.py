class RecurringEventDefinition(EmbeddedDocument):
    """
    Represents the definition of a recurring event. Is stored as an embedded
    document of Event with the field 'recurrence' The definition is based off of
    the ics format. For more see: http://www.kanzaki.com/docs/ical/rrule.html

    Certain fields must be used with others and some cannot be used with others.
    See the link above for more information.

    Fields: frequency       The frequency of an event. Required. Takes a string
    from a list of choices ('DAILY', 'WEEKLY', 'MONTHLY', 'YEARLY') Example:
    'WEEKLY' (event occurs every week)

    interval        The interval between events. Required. Takes a string of an
                    integer. Example: '2' (would be every 2 days, 2 weeks, 2
                    months, or 2 years depending on frequency)

    count           How many events should occur. Optional. Takes a string of an
                    integer. 'Until' and 'count' cannot both be used. Example:
                    '6' (event occurs 6 times)

    until           Date at which event should stop occuring. Optional Takes a
                    datetime object. 'Until' and 'count' cannot both be used.
                    Example: datetime(2017, 7, 31) (event stops occuring on July
                    31, 2017)

    by_day          Which day of the week an event should occur. Optional Takes

                    every Tuesday and Friday)

    by_month_day    Which day of the month an event should occur. Optional Takes
                    a string of an integer Example: '20' (event occurs on the
                    20th of a month)

    by_month        Which month an event should occur in. Optional Takes a list
                    of strings of integers from 1 through 12 Example: ['6', '7']
                    (event occurs in June and July)

    by_year_day     Which day of the year an event should occur on. Optional
                    Takes a list of strings of integers from 1 through 365
                    Example: ['1', '100', '200'] (event occurs on the 1rst,
                    100th, and 200th day of the year)

    forever         Indicates whether this recurrence has an end. Optional to
                    define, but will default to False Takes a boolean Example:
                    True (True indicates this event goes on forever)

class RecurringEventExc(EmbeddedDocument):  # TODO: get a better name
    """
    Represents the definition of an event that is part of a recurring series, but has been
    edited to be different from the series. This definition will be stored as an embedded document
    in the recurring event field "sub_events".
    These events are referred to as a sub_event.

    This class only saves the fields that are explicitly different from its parent event.
    When sending this event in the API, the fields that have not been changed (so they're not saved
    in this object), will inherit from the parent event.

    Fields:
